<p>Although Mercury's speaking voice naturally fell in the baritone range, he delivered most songs in the tenor range.[32] His known vocal range extended from bass low F (F2) to soprano high F (F6). He could belt up to tenor high F (F5). <br> Biographer David Bret described his voice as "escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfect coloratura, pure and crystalline in the upper reaches"</p>
